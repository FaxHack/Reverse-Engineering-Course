THE "Malware" PROGRAM PERFORMS ACTIONS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED MALICIOUS.
By running the program you agree to take full responsibility for anything it does. I (the author) am not responsible for anything it does.

Malware.Z0F is the malware that the dropper (Dropper.Z0F) downloads.
To execute either the malware or dropper programs give them the ".exe" extension. Example: "Dropper.exe".

The DebugFiles folder contains debug files that can be used to resolve symbols.

The SourceCode folder contains the source code for the programs.
