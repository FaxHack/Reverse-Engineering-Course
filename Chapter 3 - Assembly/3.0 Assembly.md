# Chapter 3 - Assembly

This chapter will act as a crash course or refresher for the Assembly language. This course focuses on x64 Assembly. This is in no way a full Assembly course and you should take a full Assembly course before continuing. You do not need an advanced understanding of Assembly, but you should be able to write basic Assembly programs.
